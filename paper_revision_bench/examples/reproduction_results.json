This specificity is crucial in academic titles to convey the scope and focus of the research accurately. The revised title, while slightly more concise, loses this specificity, which could lead to ambiguity about whether the paper discusses a single decision-making process or multiple tasks. Therefore, the original title is better in terms of clarity and informativeness.",

It introduces the acronym 'HTFlows', which is likely defined in the paper, making the title more concise and easier to reference. Additionally, the phrase 'A Novel Framework' highlights the innovation of the research, enhancing the academic appeal. The inclusion of both the specific method 'Heterophilous Triple Flows' and the general topic 'Molecule Generation' broadens the scope of understanding for a wider academic audience. This title is clearer, more engaging, and aligns well with academic writing standards.",

It aligns well with the key concepts introduced in the abstract and introduction, which emphasize the challenges of using homophily-based methods and the need for a model that can handle heterophily patterns in molecular data. The term \"Heterophilous Triple Flows\" succinctly describes the multiple interactive flows designed to capture and utilize heterophily in the generation process, making the title both informative and reflective of the paper's content.",
