Specifically, we identify structure and appearance as the most intuitive and useful properties for editing. We propose **PAIR** Diffusion, a generic framework that enables a diffusion model to control the structure and appearance properties of each object in the image. This framework provides comprehensive editing capabilities, allowing for various object-level operations such as reference image-based appearance editing, free-form shape editing, adding objects, and variations. Our design eliminates the need for inversion steps. Additionally, we introduce multimodal classifier-free guidance, which allows for editing using both reference images and text when using our approach with foundational diffusion models.

In this work, we tackle the task by perceiving the images as an amalgamation of various objects and aim to control the properties of each object in a fine-grained manner. Out of these properties, we identify structure and appearance as the most intuitive to understand and useful for editing purposes. We propose **PAIR** Diffusion, a generic framework that can enable a diffusion model to control the structure and appearance properties of each object in the image. We show that having control over the properties of each object in an image leads to comprehensive editing capabilities. Our framework allows for various object-level editing operations on real images such as reference image-based appearance editing, free-form shape editing, adding objects, and variations.

      "revised_text": "Generative image editing has recently experienced rapid advancements, with some methods utilizing high-level conditioning, such as text, while others employ low-level conditioning. However, most current approaches fall short in providing fine-grained control over the properties of individual objects within images, which is essential for object-level image editing. In this work, we address this gap by treating images as a collection of distinct objects, allowing us to effectively manage and edit the properties of each object at a granular level. Specifically, we focus on two key properties: structure and appearance. Our proposed framework, **PAIR** Diffusion, enables diffusion models to precisely control these properties for each object in an image. We demonstrate that achieving control over these properties enhances the overall editing capabilities of our framework. Our approach supports various object-level editing operations, including reference image-based appearance editing, free-form shape editing, and the addition of new objects. Notably, our design eliminates the need for an inversion step. Furthermore, we introduce multimodal classifier-free guidance, which facilitates editing with both reference images and text when applied to foundational diffusion models.

It clarifies that the federated learning is dealing with 'dynamic mixtures of distributions' rather than just 'dynamic data distributions', which provides a clearer understanding of the context and complexity of the data involved. This specificity enhances the academic rigor and appeal of the paper by precisely describing the conditions under which the federated learning is applied.",

      "explanation": "The revised title is better as it is more concise and uses more standard terminology. 'Generating Molecular 3D Conformers' is clearer and more direct than 'Efficient Molecular 3D Conformation Generation', making the purpose of the paper more immediately understandable. The removal of 'Torsion' in the revised title avoids potential confusion without losing the essence of the subject, as 'Sequential Modeling' still implies a methodological approach relevant to the topic.",

It effectively communicates the main elements of the research while placing the emphasis on the methodology ('Progressive Conditional Diffusion Models') which is likely the novel aspect of the research. The original title, while informative, is slightly more cumbersome due to its structure and the phrase 'through a Three-Stage Progressive Conditional Diffusion Framework' which could be seen as overly specific for a title.
